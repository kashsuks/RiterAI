Abstract:
A systematic literature search of JPN/EDG, JPN and CPTE databases and meta-analytics was conducted to determine the contents of the PubMed search, using an in-depth search of the databases which includes JPN / PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web, PubMed search and the relevant JPT articles. The full text of the data were summarised by the authors to be extracted using Microsoft Excel. The keywords examined were: human and bovine cancers, coronary heart disease, systolic blood pressure, cerebrovascular disease, liver disease, prostate disease, respiratory disease, diabetes, endometriosis and prostate cancer. The findings from the systematic search have not changed a bit with each meta-analysis.
